    <h1>SaaS</h1>
  </i>
  <h3>Basical information:</h3>
  <p>
    SaaS is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is
    <br> licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. SaaS is typically
    <br> accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Benefits and capabilities:</h3>
  <p>The quickly growing Cloud application Service represents the largest cloud market in the
    <br> world. SaaS uses the web to deliver applications that are managed by a third-party
    <br> vendor and whose interface is accessed on the client's’ side.
  </p>
  <p>The most Saas applications don’t need any downloads or installations,
    <br> just some required
    <a href="https://codecanyon.net/tags/saas" target="_blank">plugins.</a> If you have these plugins, applications can be run directly
    <br> from a web browser.
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The web delivery model is the reason, why the need to install and run
    <br> applications on individual computers is no longer required.
  </p>
  <p>With SaaS, it’s easy for enterprises to streamline their
    <br> maintenance and support, because everything can be managed by vendors:
    <br> applications, runtime, data, middleware, OSes, virtualization, servers,
    <br> storage and networking.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Examples of usage:</h3>
  <p>
    <i>SaaS examples:</i> Google Apps; Salesforce; Workday; Concur; Citrix GoToMeeting

  <h3>Business impact:</h3>
  <p>The success of SaaS has an impact on IT infrastructure in the following ways:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Easy to use:</p>
      <p>
        One of the most important differences to a traditional software is that
        <br> a SaaS-product don’t have to be installed. This means that IT support is no longer
        <br> required for setup and maintenance. After the registration is finished, the product can be used immediately.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Lower costs:</p>
      <p>
        Because of the unnecessary hardware, the costs are lower than in
        <br> traditional applications and the software doesn’t has to be maintained.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Constant updates:</p>
      <p>
        The provider does not only care about the maintenance of the software,
        <br> also the constant further development of features is the worry of the
        <br> provider.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

    <h1>PaaS</h1>
  </i>
  <h3>Basical information:</h3>
  <p>
    PaaS is a category of cloud computing that provides a platform and environment to allow
    <br> developers to build applications and services over the internet. PaaS services are hosted in the
    <br> cloud and accessed by users simply via their web browser.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Benefits and capabilities:</h3>
  <p>
    PaaS is used for applications, and other development, while providing cloud
    <br> components to software. What developers get with PaaS is a framework they can build upon to
    <br> develop or customize applications. PaaS makes the development, testing, and deployment of applications quick,
    <br> simple, and cost-effective. Developers, however, manage the applications.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Enterprise PaaS provides line-of-business software developers a self-service portal for managing computing
    <br> infrastructure from centralized IT operations and the platforms that are installed on top of the hardware.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Similar to the way in which you might create macros in Excel, PaaS allows you to create applications using
    <br> software components that are built into the PaaS middleware.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Applications using PaaS inherit cloud characteristic such as scalability, high-availability, multi-tenancy, SaaS enablement,
    <br> and more.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Enterprises benefit from PaaS because it reduces the amount of coding necessary, automates business policy,
    <br> and helps migrate apps to hybrid model. For the needs of enterprises and other organizations,
    <br> Apprenda is one provider of a private cloud PaaS for .NET and Java.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Examples of usage:</h3>
  <p>
    <i>PaaS examples:</i>
    Apprenda; Amazon Web Services
  </p>
  <br>
  <i>
    <h1>IaaS</h1>
  </i>
  <h3>Basical information:</h3>
  <p>
    IaaS is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Benefits and capabilities</h3>
  <p>
    Self-service models for accessing, monitoring, and managing remote datacenter
    <br> infrastructures, such as compute (virtualized or bare metal), storage, networking, and networking services.
    <br> Instead of having to purchase hardware outright, users can purchase IaaS based on consumption,
    <br> similar to electricity or other utility billing. Compared to SaaS and PaaS, IaaS users are responsible for
    <br> managing applications, data, runtime and middleware. Providers still manage virtualization, servers, hard drives, storage, and networking.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    What users get with IaaS is infrastructure on top of which they can install any required platform like OpenNode or Proxmox VE.
    <br> Users are responsible for updating these if new versions are released.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Examples of usage:</h3>
  <p>
    <i>IaaS examples:</i>
    Amazon Web Services (AWS); Cisco Metapod; Microsoft Azure; Google Compute Engine (GCE)
  </p>
  <br>

    <h1>Similarities</h1>
  </i>
  <p>
    The similarity between SaaS, PaaS and IaaS is, that every one of them is one of three main categories of cloud computing services.
    <br> Important here is, that the services SaaS and PaaS cannot function without a running computer infrastructure.
    <br> SaaS is more a advanced software service than a basic software, that's why SaaS cannot function without a basic software platform (PaaS).
    <br> So the cloud computing services can be categorized in this case-system:

  <br>
  <i>
    <h1>Various business models:</h1>
  </i>
  <p>
    Besides the cloud computing services there are other various business models.
    <br> The most common business models are:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <i>
        <h4>the licensing business:</h4>
      </i>
      <p>
        Standardized software-systems and services as a licence to buy.
        <br> The main reason for the great success of this model is the business on
        <br> the mass market.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>
        <h4>the project business:</h4>
      </i>
      <p>
        The customized development and maintenance of software is carried out
        <br> in projects. The difference between the licensing business and the project business is,
        <br> that the project determines the product.
        <br>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>
        <h4>the IT-system service business:</h4>
      </i>
      <p>
        Through the consistent use of web technologies, the services are no
        <br> longer bound to a specific technical infrastructure, just as in the classic
        <br> data center, but can be made available almost anywhere in the Internet.
        <br> Cloud computing is a markedness of the IT-system service business.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
    <br>
    <i>
      <h1>What's On-premise?</h1>
    </i>
    <p>
      On-premise defines a use- and license model for server-based Computer programs (aka Software).
      <br> The Data-center of On-premise-user is in their own facility,
      <br> that’s why the responsibility of the servers are the task of them, too.
    </p>

        <h1>On-premise vs. SaaS</h1>

        <h1>Competitors software models</h1>
        </i>
    <p>Most of the big software companies are still trying to get out of the On-premise model,
      <br> but such a big switch is not so easy to make. That's why many companies are offering
      <br> both software models.
